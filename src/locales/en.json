      "paragraph1": "<a href=\"https://www.xoev.de/die_standards/lateinische_zeichen_in_unicode-4813\"><em>Latin characters in Unicode</em></a> is a standard created by the <a href=\"https://www.xoev.de/\"><em>Coordination Office for IT Standards (KOSIT)</em></a> on behalf of the <a href=\"https://www.it-planungsrat.de/\"><em>IT Planning Council</em></a> (for the Federal Republic of Germany). In summary, the standard defines what Unicode-compliant processing for the <em>German public administration</em> is. With the decision <a href=\"http://www.it-planungsrat.de/DE/Entscheidungen/2014/13_Sitzung/13_Sitzung_Entscheidungen.html\">2014/04</a>, the IT Planning Council at its 13th meeting defined the characterset <em>Latin characters in UNICODE</em>, which must be supported by IT procedures in the <em>Federal Republic of Germany</em>.",
      "paragraph2": "In addition to the correct processing of <em>Latin characters in Unicode</em>, it is also important to support users in entering the required characters as easily and conveniently as possible. For this purpose, the tool <strong>Kiwi</strong> (<strong>Ki</strong>nderleicht <strong>W</strong>ortbestandteile <strong>i</strong>ntegrieren; engl. Integrate word components with ease) was created, which can be used without installation on all clients (PC, Smartphone, Tablet, etc.)."

      "title": "Concept / Idea",
      "paragraph1": "The idea of the Kiwi application is <em>not</em> to replace the input device, but to make the characters accessible and findable that are not easy to find on it. Every device already has an input option perfectly adapted to its typical use: keyboard, on-screen keyboard, etc.",
      "paragraph2": "The concept for finding characters is that the user identifies the correct character through visual comparison, which does not require knowledge of pronunciation and meaning. To make the visual comparison as simple as possible, the number of possible characters can be limited by optically related characters (base characters). The integration with the application is done by means of the system clipboard, like with the usual tools like desktop calculator.",
      "paragraph3": "In the <a href=\"#example\">example below</a>, the large number of characters is filtered by entering the base character \"s\", which are closest to the searched character \"š\". All characters that can be reached directly via the standard input device, which is usually the vast majority, are entered as usual."

    "example": {
      "title": "Quickstart",
      "description": "The name \"Miloš\" is to be typed with a German keyboard on which the character \"š\" cannot be found:",
      "steps": [
        "In Kiwi, \"Milos\" is entered via the keyboard as usual. Here you first use the German \"s\" (only the base character, without the check mark above it).",
        "Use the enter key (↵) or the magnifying glass icon to start a search.",
        "The \"keyboard\" now shows different \"s\" variants. With a mouse click, the searched \"š\" is displayed in the search result selected and automatically transferred to the input field (the simple \"s\" is replaced!).",
        "<em>Ctrl+C</em> (or the symbol with the two overlapping rectangles) will copy all the characters in the input field to the system clipboard.",
        "With <em>Ctrl+V</em> (or the usual methods for pasting from the clipboard) the name is entered in the form field of the application."
